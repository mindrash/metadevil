Discovering interesting utility, patterns, and representations of metadata.

## hexaDomain nft
Given x number of domain names and their attributes, visual each in a pleasing way. This may illict several thoughts and questions including:
- While this information is public domain it feels ... unusual to represent as an individual nft
- Will some domains seem more worthwhile to own?
- Will categories of domains be more prized and others shunned?
- Some may have very different reasons for wanting or liking each. Maybe one is a top teir traffic domain, another is you place of work, your favorite hobby, or just weird...
- Hopefully the art of the visualization above all else ... is the appeal

## Domain Selection
- Find a source of 10,000 domain names
- Will whois be used for more attributes?
- Content rating - Not light vs dark but perhaps temperature cold to hot
- Any other attributes to feed into the algorith for vidualization?

## Visualization
Python graphic visualization. I think off chain for this project even though I am very interested still in on chain.

## Chain Selection
I am leaning towards ETH since it is what I have learned, but Tezos also seems like a direction to consider now and in the future.
